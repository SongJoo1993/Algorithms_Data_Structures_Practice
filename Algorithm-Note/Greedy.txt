Greedy Algorithm
- An algorithm to find the best option available among local options.
- Works in a top-down approach
- This algorithm may not produce the best solutions for all problems.
- When to use this algorithm:
    - Greedy Choice Property
        * Only if an optimal solution can be found at each step without recosidering the previous steps.
    - Optimal Substructure
        * If the optimal overall solution is equal/corresponds to the optimal solution to its subproblems.
